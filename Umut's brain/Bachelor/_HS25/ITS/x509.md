# Fields
## Subject
The subject is the entity that the certificate is about - the one being certified. It identifies who or what owns that public key in the certificate.
E.g. In a Website TLS certificate, the subject is the website / domain (e.g. CN=example.com)
## Issuer
The issuer is the entity that created and signed the certificate - the one vouching for the subject‘s identity. It‘s the authority saying „I certify that this public key belongs to this subject.“
E.g. in a Website‘s TLS certificate, the issuer is typically a CA like Let‘s encrypt or DigiCert.

### When subject and issuer match
In this case it means, that the certificate is a self-signed certificate. This is always the case for CA certificates, but not every self-signed
certificate is also a CA certificate.
