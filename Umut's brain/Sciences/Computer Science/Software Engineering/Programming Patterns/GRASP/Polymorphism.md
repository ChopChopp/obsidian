# Core principal
Assign responsibilities to types and objects so that behavior varies by type, using polymorphic operations instead of conditional logic to handle type-based variations.

# The problem it solves
- **Excessive conditional statements** based on type checking (if-else chains, switch statements)
- **Rigid code** that's difficult to extend with new types
